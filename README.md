# 💿 lavaplayer

An audio player library written in Java which can load audio tracks from various sources and convert them
into a stream of Opus frames. 

It is designed for use with Discord bots, but it can be used anywhere where Opus format
output is required.

## 👁️ changes

This fork has been heavily modified for use within my bot, [**Mixtape**](https://mixtape.systems). There are _many_ breaking changes that have been made and I've tracked not a single one of them, so don't expect a smooth migration.

That being said, don't expect me to help you with migrating. If you however want to give it a shot I might help you in my [Development Server](https://mixtape.systems/development).

###### _Good Luck!_
